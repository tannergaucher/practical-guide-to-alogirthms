# Notes on the Frontend Masters Course Practical Guide to Algorithms

**Algorithm:** Steps that you take to solve a prolblem.

Why care? It's an engineers job to solve problems.

Identify pattern => Apply correct algorithm => Solve problem in optimal way

## Time Complexity

How we estimate the speed of an algorithm.

> "As the input grows, it will grow in this proportion."

How many operations are expected to solve problem, in respect to input size.

**Example Problem:** Given list of hotels, figure out the min and max price.

Commmon run times from fast to very slow:

- Contast 0(1)
- Logarithmic 0(logn)
- Linear 0(n)
- Quadratic 0(n2)
- Exponential 0(k^n)

**Logarithmic Time:** As input increases, number of operations decreases by a fraction. Time complexity increases by a fraction, thus it grows slowly. Often better than linear time w/ large datasets.

## Space Complexity

The space that is taken up in memory. Works in similar way to time, but on question of how much more space are we taking up.

**Memoization:** When you cache the result of a funciton. A type of caching.

**Caching:** Saving something into an object or arary.

Caching trades time complexity for space complexity. Important when the callback function is expensive, and usually the right tradeoff in a browser environment.

Example Problem: Factorial 5!

5 X 4 X 3 X 2 X 1

## Recursion

When a function calls itself, until it doesn't.

An elegant solution to keep code DRY

**Recursion in 4 steps:**

1. Identify base case.
2. Identify recursive case.
3. Return where appropriate.
4. Write procedures for each case that bring you closer to the base case.

Recursion can always be implemented as a loop, but it's often more simple to use recursion.

Patterns:

- Wrapper function
- Accumulator function

### Divide and Conquer

A resursive technique:

- Take large problem
- Divide into sub-problems

### Binary Search

Search for a value in a **_sorted_** array, by cutting the side of the search area in half.

Steps:

- Break sorted array in half
- Is value the value that we're looking for < or > current location
- Repeat

### Linear Search

Simply loop through a list, and look for that number.

## Sorting

Naive sorts: Keep looping and comparing values until list is sorted.

- Bubble sort
- Insertion sort
- Selection sort

Divide and conquer sort: Recursively devide list / smaller parts of list until entire list is sorted.

- Mergesort
- Quicksort

For sorting algorithms, you must look at every value, can never be less than linear time.

## Greedy Algorithms

Takes the short sighted solution. Given a decision, do the one that looks like the best decision at that time, without considering the big picture.

Always making the locally optimal choice does not always give the optimal solution.

When to use: Data set is so large that you can't think of all scenarios. It's computationally too much and it's better to had **_a_** solution than none at all.

## Dynamic Programming

Optimization technique

Cache values when doing work inside the subproblems. If you have a solution that you can cache, that's dynamic programming.

Different ways of caching:

- Top down, recursive approach
- Bottom up, iterative technique

## On How to Learn and Improve

Talk about how code is executing. Reason about it. Don't just run and see what happens. Be able to reason through what you are writing.

In a typical interview environment, you **_can't_** run the code. Need to learn how to debug, run the code in your head.
